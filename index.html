					<h4> Attitudes are weak predictors of behaviour </h4>

					<img data-src="./images/customer.png" style= "width: 250px; height:250px; border-style: none; box-shadow: none"><br>
					<br>
					<span class="fragment">Psychologists have known for a long time that attitudes are weak predictors of behaviour (e.g. LaPiere, 1934)<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">A great deal of market research is done by asking a small number of people what they think (e.g. focus groups) <br></span><br>
					<span class="fragment">This data is used to build profiles of customer segments and relevant marketing strategies </span>
				</small>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> In the beginning </h4>
					<small>
					<img data-src="./images/dunnhumby.png" style= "border-style: none; box-shadow: none"><br>
					<br>
					<span class="fragment">Edwina Dunn and Clive Humby formed dunnhumby in 1989<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">Their founding belief was that the best data on customers was already owned by businesses (e.g. EPOS data) (i.e. not necessarily attitudinal)<br></span><br>
					<span class="fragment">dunnhumby quickly became driving force behind the Tesco Clubcard <br></span>			</small>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> The power of tracking repeat purchases </h4>
					<small>
					<img data-src="./images/clubcard.jpg" style= "width: 319px; height:212px;border-style: none; box-shadow: none"><br>
					<br>
					<span class="fragment">Customers can exist in data thanks to their repeat purchases (e.g. using a Clubcard ID)<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">Understanding what customers like and don't like creates the marketing equivalent of a <b>DNA profile</b> <br></span><br>
					<span class="fragment">dunnhumby pitched this idea during a trial with Tesco... <br></span><br>
					<span class="fragment">"What scares me about this is that you know more about my customers after three months than I know after 30 years" Lord McLaurin, ex Chairman of Tesco<br></span>

					<span class="fragment">Grocery retailers affect people's most fundamental needs (e.g. food, clothing, finances).</span><br>
					<span class="fragment">People have different needs and <b>get frustrated if they're not met</b> (Maslow, 1943)</span><br>

					<h4> We use machine learning to aid decision-making </h4>
					<small>
					<img data-src="./images/net.png" style= "border-style: none; box-shadow: none"><br><br>

					<span class="fragment">Machine Learning algorithms sweep through enormous amounts of data, so that customers don't have to<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">We receive 1.45bn rows of transactional data every 4 weeks from one retailer (= lots of data)<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">Machine learning enables us to build personalisation algorithms that learn what individual customers like<br></span><br>
					<span class="fragment">This can be used to solve <b>long tail problem</b>, <b>minimises irrelevant communications</b> and <b>ease complex decision-making</b> <br></span>

					<h3> Case Study: Have you forgotten? </h3>
					<img data-src="./images/forgot.png" style= "width: 350px; height:300px;border-style: none; box-shadow: none"><br><br>
					<small>
					<span class="fragment">This algorithm recommends products that we think you've forgotten this week<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">It uses <b>past shopping behaviour</b> and <b>relevancy scores</b> to determine what has been forgotten and what has been intentionally left out<br><br></span>

					<span class="fragment">This simple feature aims to aid complex decision-making, so that it's less overwhelming</span><br>
					</span class="fragment">(Interestingly, people's propensity to use this feature depends on <i>how</i> they search for products, see Hornsby & Love, 2022, <i>Science Advances</i></span>
					</small>

				<!-- Section 4: Subjective choice -->
				<section data-background="#C92C99">
					<h2> Subjective choices can be surprising </h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> Why do you buy what you buy? </h4>
					<small>
					<img data-src="./images/jam.png" style= "width: 140px; height:190px; border-style: none; box-shadow: none"><br><br>
					<span class="fragment">There are an infinite number of dimensions that people can use to value a product, and these dimensions vary in subjective importance<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">This contrasts with objective choice, where people can choose options based on a single criterion (e.g. price)<br><br></span>
					<span class="fragment">Understanding how customers make subjective choices is a big research topic at dunnhumby (e.g. several PhD sponsors)<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">This will help build better targeting algorithms, store layouts and simulations (amongst other things)<br></span>
					</small>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> Research topic: Exploration patterns in the supermarket </h4>
					<small>
					<img data-src="./images/streak.jpg" style= "width: 555px; height:283px; border-style: none; box-shadow: none"><br>
					<span class="fragment">In a recent research project, we tried to understand <b>exploration patterns</b> of products<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">When do people try different products (i.e. explore) and when do they try the same (i.e. exploit)?<br><br></span>

					<span class="fragment">Normative/objective theories of choice suggest that people's p(explore) should increase the more they exploit (i.e. <b>maximising information</b>)<br><br></span>
					<span class="fragment">But we know that determining value of subjective choices can be an interpretive exercise (e.g. Hall et al. 2010 jam tasting study)<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">So perhaps we will see a reversed trend, where p(explore) decreases with more exploitation (i.e. <b>maximising coherency</b>)<br></span>
					</small>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> the study was conducted on 300k customers </h4>
					<small>
					<img data-src="./images/explore.png" style= "width: 500px; height:100px; border-style: none; box-shadow: none"><br><br>

					<span class="fragment">Repeat purchases were coded as 'exploitations'<br><br></span>
					<span class="fragment">On historic data, results suggested that the probability of exploring new products was much higher for shorter exploitation streaks than expected<br><br></span>
					<span class="fragment">To validate these findings, explore/exploit coffee coupons were sent to customers with different streak lengths... </span>
					</small>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> The coupon study confirmed that people were coherency maximising </h4>
					<small>
					<img data-src="./images/coupon.png" style= "width: 450px; height:235px; border-style: none; box-shadow: none"><br><br>

					<span class="fragment">Exploratory coupons were more likely to be redeemed when exploitation streaks were short<br></span>
					<span class="fragment">Suggests that <b>preferences follow choices</b><br></span>
					<span class="fragment">We confirmed this in lab studies, reported in Hornsby & Love (2020b), <i>Cognition</i></b><br><br></span>

					<span class="fragment">Results run contrary to normative models of choice; subjective choices can be suprising!<br></span>
